sturdy bash, nvim, tmux, and git config

## Requirements
- bash (obvs)
- nvim (obvs)
- tmux (obvs)
- fzf
- fzf-extras
- zoxide

## Note

Pretty much all of the aliases and functions in the bash.d directory depend on third-party applications (exa, rg, fd, to name a few). 
If you want to hawk the config, you'll have to peruse the source and figure it out on your own. Sorry dudes.


## RE: unsanitary commit practices

Sorry. I am typically a good gitizen.

## Thanks

To [yadm](https://github.com/TheLocehiliosan/yadm) for sparing me symlink headaches
(why can't I ever remember the argument orders for ln? it's like there's a hole in my brain there)
