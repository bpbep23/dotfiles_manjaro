sturdy bash, nvim, tmux, and git config

## Requirements
- bash (obvs)
- nvim (obvs)
- tmux (obvs)
- fzf
- fzf-extras
- zoxide

## Note

Pretty much all of the aliases and functions in the bash.d directory depend on third-party applications (exa, rg, fd, to name a few). 
If you want to hawk the config, you'll have to peruse the source and figure it out on your own. Sorry dudes.
